# K-Means


## What problem this project solves?
This project is simple(maybe not effective)implementation of K-Means algorithm using python

###  Some Clarifications
   * **ReadandPlot.py** -is not needed and recommended(It is just rough,linear and very dirty way of solving K-Means algorithms. I just wrote it to understand general idea.)
   


### How to run this on your computer
   1. Make sure you ...
      * have python 3 installed on your computer
      * have imported needed packages
      * have changed path given in **ReadData.py** class to your own **.txt** file
      * use only
         * *ReadData.py*
         * *Clustrer.py*
         * *data_for_exercise4.txt*
      
   2. Then just run **Clustrer.py**
   
#### What is good about this project?
   * This code is partly **Object Oriented**
   * It solves problem
   * functions are very polite. they do not  say **object.update_centroid()** they say **object.please_update_centroid()**
   * I am emotionally **attached** to code
   * Code is hard commented
#### What is bad about this project?
   * This code is **partly** Object Oriented
   * Some part of code is hard coded
   * I am **emotionally** attached to code
