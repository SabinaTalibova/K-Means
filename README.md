*What you need is: *
    *ReadData.py *
    *Clusterer.py *
    *data_for_exercise4.txt*
 
###How to run this code onyour computer###
*You have python 3 installed in your computer*
*needed libraries are installed(see imported modules)*
*make sure to change path in ReadData.py class to your .txt file destination*
